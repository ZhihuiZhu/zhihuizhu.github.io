<h3>Lab Mission</h3>
<p>The <b>Data, Computation and Learning</b> Lab is newly established by Dr. Zhihui Zhu in 2020 in the Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Denver. Our research spans a wide range of areas in the fields of data science, machine learning, signal processing, and computational optimization. In particular, we are interested in developing computational methods that can efficiently and reliably extract meaningful representations from large-scale and high-dimensional signals and data. The applications include biomedical engineering, computational imaging, geophysics and remote sensing, etc. Some of the work has been published in top machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR, and top-tiers journals in IEEE Trans. and SIAM, etc. A few current projects include 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Machine learning</b>: generalization properties and implicit regularization; model (neural network) compression; federated learning; deep neural networks for unsupervised learning and inverse problems;</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Data/signal processing</b>: low-dimensional data representations such as sparsity, low-rank structure, and manifold to perform practical signal and data processing tasks;</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Optimization</b>: Nonconvex geometric analysis; distributed optimization; the design, analysis, and implementation of large-scale optimization algorithms for engineering problems.<br />

<br />

Some of these projects are in collaboration with CSM, JHU, NYU, UC Berkeley, Microsoft, etc.
